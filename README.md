> [Helio Workstation](https://helioworkstation.com) is free and open-source music sequencer, designed to be used on all major platforms.

### Why another sequencer?

Most of the DAW interfaces often seem overcomplicated, and they only tend to get more and more bloated over time. Also most of the DAWs are commercial, proprietary-licensed and almost none of them support all major operating systems at the same time.

Helio aims to be a modern music creation tool, featuring linear-based sequencer with a clean interface, high-performance C++ core, integrated version control providing intelligent synchronization between devices, saved undo history, translations to many languages and more.
