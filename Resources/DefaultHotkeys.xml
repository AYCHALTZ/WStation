    <!--
        Hotkey scheme supports 3 types of nodes: 'KeyPress', 'KeyDown' and 'KeyUp'.
        Each has 3 attributes:
          - 'Receiver' attribute, which is a component id.
                Only a child of a currently visible page will recieve events.
          - 'Command' attribute (see CommandIDs.h for available commands)
          - 'Key' attribute, which is case-insensitive textual combination
                of keys (letters or specific) and modifiers (if any).
                Modifier names: "alt", "shift", "control", "command".
                Non-letter hotkey names:
                    "spacebar", "return",
                    "escape", "backspace",
                    "cursor left", "cursor right", "cursor up", "cursor down",
                    "page up", "page down",
                    "home", "end",
                    "delete", "insert",
                    "tab", "play", "stop", "fast forward", "rewind".
